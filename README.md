# Focus stacking and depth synthesis

This repo contains some experiments about focus stacking, i.e.
synthesis of in-focus areas of different images.

Simultaneously a depth map of the scene is reconstructed by
taking advantage of a priori knowledge of the images taken,
such as focal distance of each image.
